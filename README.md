# 👋 Hey, I'm Rahq! 
### Just a Java Addict wandering through the world of Backend... ☕

## 🧐 The Lowdown (About Me)
I'm a Junior Backend Developer who lives in the terminal. I tell people I like "learning while diving," which mostly means I jump into complex documentation without a life jacket and see if I can swim. 

When I'm not fighting with semi-colons in Java, I'm probably experimenting with Node.js or customizing my Ubuntu setup because I can't leave well enough alone.

## 🛠️ My Toolbelt (Skills)

### The "Bread and Butter"
* **Java**: My first love. We have a complicated relationship, but I can't stay away.

* **Spring Boot**: Making Java feel like it's actually from this decade.

* **Node.js**: I'm finishing my course here. It's fast, it's weird, I kind of like it.

### The "Comfort Zone"
* **Linux (Ubuntu)**: If it’s not running GNOME on Ubuntu, is it even a real computer? 🐧

* **Postman**: My best friend for when my APIs decide to be difficult.

## 🧪 The Lab (Public Projects)

* **[CCSProject](https://github.com/Rahq5/CCSProject-Centralized-Cloud-Storage-Project)**: I turned a Raspberry Pi into a cloud. It’s like Google Drive, but it lives in my house.
* **[IEEE-754 Converter](https://github.com/Rahq5/IEEE-754-DoublePrecisionConverter)**: My first Node.js project. It handles numbers so you don't have to. 
* **[ChatApp](https://github.com/Rahq5/ChatApp)**: Because every dev needs to build a chat app at least once. It's the law.

## 🎯 Current Quest
Right now, I'm obsessed with **Distributed Systems** and **Cache Consistency**. If you want to talk about Edge Computing or why my Ubuntu setup looks better than yours, hit me up!
